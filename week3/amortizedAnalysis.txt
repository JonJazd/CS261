1. 86 cost units. The average complexity is around O(2.1n) as just before it doubles the complexity will be O(1.5n)
and just after it will be around O(2.6n) 

2. 408 cost units. The average complexity is very high as each 2 spaces increases the cost by n+1 so that it is almost constantly redoing the entire array.
